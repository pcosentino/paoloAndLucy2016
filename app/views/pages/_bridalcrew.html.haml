						%h2 Rose Libreri Giovannelli
						%h3 Maid of Honor-Sister of Bride  
						%p One of my older sisters, Rose has been and is still my style icon. Although growing up together was sometimes challenging due to stolen hair products, clothing and makeup, our sibling bond has only become stronger.

						%h2 Angela Libreri Guttilla

						%p Oldest sibling of the Libreri household, Angela has and will always be Mommy #2. Angela is the most genuine and safest person I've ever known. And by safe, I mean hands on 2 and 10 on the steering wheel at all times, even when her favorite jam comes on the radio. With a love for dancing and a laugh so vibrant and loud, you can't help but fall in love with Angela's fun, likeable and entertaining personality.

Being a fashion major, I like to consider Margaret as my own personal stylist in desperate moments. Besides sharing our closets, we share an amazing relationship with unforgettable (and some embarrassing) life memories that continue to multiple. 
					.item.slide4

						=image_tag("pic.jpg", id:"#")
						%h2 Bianca Onrubia
