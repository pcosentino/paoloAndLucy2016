Laura has a severe case of cinephilia with the ability to quote any and all movies she's ever watched. Lucia is lucky to gain Laura as a younger sister.

						=image_tag("margaret.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Margaret Trupiano 
						%h3 Cousin of Bride 
						%p More of a sister than a cousin, Margaret has always been Lucia's go-to for laughs, a crying shoulder or a good movie to fall asleep to before it even begins.

Besides sharing their closets, they share an amazing relationship with unforgettable (and some embarrassing) life memories that continue to grow and multiple.

						%h2 Antonietta Sparacio Libreri 
						%h3 Sister-In-Law of Bride

					.item.slide12
						=image_tag("bianca.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Bianca Onrubia 
						%h3 Close Friend of Bride
						%p Otherwise known as B, she is probably the most amazing Filipino you will ever meet in your life. Bianca and Lucia were glued at the hips all through their grammar school years. From sleepovers, camping trips and exchanging nutella sandwiches for Filipino rice for lunch, they have been the closest of friends. Although B and Lucia currently live 92 miles apart from each other, distance has never come between their amazing friendship.

						=image_tag("johnny.jpg", id:"johnny", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Johnny Pezzuto
						%h3 Best man - Friend of Groom
						%p Between two trips to Italy together, Vegas, Mexico, four years of high school, four years of college and five years working together at the local golf course, the bond between Paolo and Johnny had no choice but to thicken. If that isn't enough bromance in one sentence, living two blocks apart and being daily workout buddies makes these two even more inseparable. Not so fast...it's not always lovey dovey between these two guys. They enjoy keeping each other in check and never hesitate to tell the other how it is. 
					.item.slide2
						=image_tag("anthony_b.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Anthony Bondi
						%h3 Brother-in-law of Groom
						%p Paolo waited patiently...27 anxious years later, he is proud to call Anthony his first brother. Anthony is always willing to lend a helping hand. Anthony is never biased in his opinions and can whip up a MEAN Sunday brunch that will leave you full for days. He and Paolo share many of the same interests including health, food and taking it easy.
					.item.slide3
						=image_tag("joey.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Joey Bruno
						%h3 Cousin of Groom
						%p Paolo has seen Joey grow into the finest, open-minded young man he is today. Joey and Paolo have shared many enthusiastic moments such as watching Bambi and Muzzy on VHS or trading Jigglypuff for Clefairy. They currently share the same enthusiasm for the comedian, Sebastian Maniscalco. Joey can recite the entire 2-hour "Aren't You Embarrassed?" comedy special. He also knows when Sebastian is coming to town, and somehow manages to purchase the presale tickets before the presale! If you want tickets, Joey's your guy.
					.item.slide4
						=image_tag("domenico.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Domenico DeRango
						%h3 Cousin of Groom
						%p Living in separate states and 70 miles of road between each other, Domenico and Paolo have never let a little distance get in the way of maintaining a strong relationship.  These two have survived a number of family trips, including a road trip to Toronto. Being two of 17 passengers, Domenico and Paolo shared an igloo cooler as their not optional seat for the entire 8 hours of travel.  Donât forget to ask these guys about how they coproduced and directed the world famous "Free Willy Show"!
					.item.slide5
						=image_tag("adriano.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Adriano Cosentino
						%h3 Cousin of Groom
						%p Paolo's go-to fantasy football secret weapon. Whether its scarfing down freezer burnt fudge bars or referring to the "rainy days", Paolo and Adriano are always on the same page, even when no one in the room knows what's going on. At the annual San Francesco Feast, you will always see these two in their "certified" attire eating a freshly sliced soppressata sandwich. 
					.item.slide6
						=image_tag("iggy.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Iggy Libreri
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p The loudest handshake River Grove has ever seen. Iggy ALWAYS has something nice to say and loves to toot Paolo's horn. Not many people would forgive you for spilling vesuvio juice all over their Calvin Klein Suit...Iggy would. Iggy has always treated Paolo like family, even before Lucia and Paolo were together.   
					.item.slide7
						=image_tag("pete.jpg", id:"peter", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Peter Libreri
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p Pete and Paolo have been very close friends since college. If Lucia hasn't given Paolo a compliment, Pete will never hesitate in stepping in and then bloat about Paolo's "massive" lats. Pete has been eating his words ever since he uttered that simple phrase: "Paolo, you should date my sister!" 
					.item.slide8
						=image_tag("aldo.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Aldo Libreri
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p Out of the entire Libreri family, Aldo gives the strongest, brotherly bear hugs. He also has a new meme for every conversation that takes place at the dinner table and in the "Whole Family" group texts. After having the honor of standing up in Aldo's wedding, Paolo felt honored yet again, when Aldo excitedly accepted to be part of Paolo's big day.
					.item.slide9
						=image_tag("claudio.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Claudio Libreri
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p Youngest of the Libreri family, Claudio will always be Paolo's "dawg". Confirmed and proudly stated, Paolo has seen Claudio with his shirt off more than he's seen him with his shirt on. Claudio can whip up the meanest frittata, risotto and steak tacos. Claudio and Paolo both share the same appreciation for country music as well as their strong man crush for Dierks Bentley.
					.item.slide10
						=image_tag("joe_g.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Joe Gutilla
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p Whether it's a friendly game of foosball, ping-pong, bags or even golf, Joe always manages to bring out the competitive (and sweaty) side of Paolo. Fair warning, a platter of warmly baked chocolate chip cookies will not last very long with these two present. If he's not giving financial advice or golf tips, Joe (with his fatherly instinct) finds himself watching Peppa Pig, Sophia the First or Frozen live and DVRed. 
					.item.slide11
						=image_tag("jerry.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Jerry Giovannelli
						%h3 Future Brother-in-Law of Groom
						%p When Paolo says he "knows a guy", Jerry is "the guy" he's referring to. Jerry has taught Paolo many skills and lessons, not only through his honest advice, but also through his work ethic and creative mindset. Whether he's chasing squirrels or creating homemade, award winning Halloween costumes for his children, Jerry will always leave your abs feeling sore with his endless jokes and subtle sarcasm.  
					.item.slide12
						=image_tag("joe_l.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Joe Lipsey
						%h3 Close Friend of Groom
						%p Tossin' bags, drinkin' beers and grillin' brats: this sums up typical summer weekends at "Joey-too-smooth Lipper's" house. âShirt: Optional...and by optional I mean tossed on the table and forgetting it ever existed. Speaking of shirt..Fellas, if you ever need a dress shirt steamed, ironed or pressed, Joe's your guy. Specialties include salsa dancing and flat dumbbell/barbell bench press (most incredible bench to body weight ratio).
					.item.slide13
						=image_tag("anthony_g.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 Anthony Giovannelli
						%h3 Future Nephew of Groom
						%p The most creative, curious kid Paolo has ever met. Anthony has more energy than the energizer bunny himself. When he is not questioning what high cholesterol is or the reason for a Myocardial Infarction, he is busy doing cartwheels, back flips and hand stands in his living room. Anthony enjoys a hobby of drawing and is destined to be the next Van Gogh.
					.item.slide14
						=image_tag("https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/plc0903/liljohn.jpg", id:"#", :size => '250x250')
						%h2 John Giovannelli
						%h3 Ring Boy - Future Nephew of Groom
						%p Even after he cold-heartedly rejected the formal request of being the Ring Bearer, he graciously accepted upon opening his gift and his eyes beheld a blueberry ring pop. Hide your IPads, gum, belts and ear lobes, all things John is obsessed with and will leave you surrendering. John is also notorious for hacking cell phones and downloading apps without consent.
